 Principle of OOPS
 ------------------
 Zomato - Use Case :)
  
 1. Think of Object | eg: Restaurant
 	1.1. Think of Attributes associated to an Object
 	eg: name, address, deliveryReviews, ratings, pricePerPerson, operatingHours, timeToDeliver etc....
 	Think as much as attribute you can think of for creating an object:)
 
 2. Code the Object as Class
 	 i.e. we need to create a class that shall represent what we want in object

 3. Create the real object in the memory
     i.e. may be in main method and read/write the data in it
 */

// Code Together :)
// Think of Use Case (Amazon, WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, Netflix, etc...) like i did Zomato
// Think of 1 object and write minimum of 5 attributes :)
// 1st think tomorrow would be to share your object and attributes when i ask for acknowledgements
// Example: Restaurant {name, address, deliveryReviews, ratings, pricePerPerson, operatingHours, timeToDeliver}

// Object is a Container which will contain lot of data :)
// Class is representation of Object :)

public class OOPSIntro {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}

}
